Gradebook Project

Process:

    1. Created a workbook and added 15 employee names with the columns safety test, Company Philosophy test, Financial skills test, Drug test
    2. To format the column names, use the orientation for a better representation. Format > Orientation > Tilt-up (Rotate the text up)
    3. Align the points to the test. Here I allocated 10.20.100 and 1 respectively according to point 1
    4. Filled in the data for representation
    5. To find out the percentage that they have scored, do the individual score/test score eg: C4/C2
    6. Convert the number to a percentage. Home> Percentage
    7.  The results are wrong when the formula is copied and pasted due to the relative referencing error. To clear, use absolute referencing, give a dollar sign before the row number. C$2 for example here.
    8. Find out the percentages for all the numbers. Use the fill command as it is the same formula for all the tests
    9. Use of conditional formatting: for better representation of the test results
    10. Conditional formatting > Color scale > Choose a good representation
    11. Finding out who scored less than 50%. Select all the percentage scores and use conditional formatting. To find out who has less than 50% of the scores, use conditional formatting > choose the cell range > select less than > reference a value or a cell number > Apply
    12. To see if you need to terminate an employee, an employee should have less than 50% in the test.
    13. Use of “OR” -  we use OR to compare if any percentage is less than 0.5/50%. If yes, then it returns TRUE, if not then FALSE
    14. FORMAT - OR(logic_1,logic_2…). Here the logic is OR(H4<.5, I4<.5, J4<.5, K4<.5) - IF any of the logic works, then it returns True
    15. Conditional formatting > Select the cell range > Select the value to be “TRUE” and format accordingly.
    16. Find out the min, max and average values in both percentages and values

Usage of Charts:

> Insert > Column Chart > Add the chart > Edit the name of the chart
> To change the horizontal axis to the names of employees for representation.


Key Points:

    1. For absolute cell referencing of a particular cell, use the $ sign after the column and before the number
    2. Fill command helps to process and deliver the same result faster
    3. Conditional formatting needs to be done to individual columns. The use of “Fill” can give different results.
